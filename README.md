Use your webcam to generate an ascii video with Python. Requires the Pillow module and a webcam module like pygame or SimpleCV. Some of this code was borrowed from https://stevendkay.wordpress.com/2009/09/08/generating-ascii-art-from-photographs-in-python/

I took the concept of ascii art and simply made a loop. If you change the font to green and background of the text widget to black...you get the idea.
